      <h2>ABOUT BAND</h2>
      <h4>OneRepublic began in 1996 when vocalist Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins were in high school.
      They both liked singers such as U2 and Fiona Apple, and since they got along well,
      they decided to form their own band. After entering different universities and going
      their separate ways, they attempted to reunite in LA in 2002. At this time, Eddie Fisher,
      Brent Kutzle, and Drew Brown joined, forming the current band lineup. The initial band name
      was Republic, but since it overlapped with another band, they added "One"
        to become OneRepublic.</h4>

      <h3> ALBUMS</h3>
      <h4>Dreaming Out Loud-2007</h4>
      <p>On September 20, 2007, with their debut album [Dreaming Out Loud],
      OneRepublic sold 75,000 copies in its first week on the U.S. charts,
      achieving a rank of 14. Despite various opinions, the first album was sufficient to establish
      the image of OneRepublic as an alternative rock band, and songs like 'Apologize' and 'Stop and Stare'
      are now considered classics.
      </p>
      <h4>Waking Up-2009</h4>
      <p>Released in 2009, the second album, "Waking Up," reached 21st place on
        the Billboard 200 chart. It achieved sales of 1 million worldwide.
        The tracks on the album reached 2x platinum and achieved remarkable success on charts worldwide, demonstrating significant accomplishments.
      </p>
      <h4>Native-2013</h4>
      <p>The widely known "Counting Stars" is included in "Native."
      The third album is also known as OneRepublic's prime time, debuting at 4th place
      on the Billboard 200 chart. It sold 60,000 copies in its first week in the United
      States alone and reached the top of charts in numerous countries worldwide.
      </p>
      <h4>Oh My My-2016</h4>
      <p>The fourth album, "Oh My My," is overall composed in a new direction.
      Ryan Tedder, who is in charge of the piano, mentioned that the album
      was composed in a new direction overall, and it shows a lot of experimental feelings.
      While the previous albums had a strong country feel, the fourth album features a stronger
      pop vibe and a psychedelic atmosphere.
      </p>
      <h4>Human-2021</h4> 
      <p>
      Human is OneRepublic's fifth studio album, released on August 27, 2021,
      through Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records, almost five years after
      their previous album Oh My My (2016). Following health issues affecting lead singer,
      songwriter, and producer Ryan Tedder, the band opted for a standalone singles strategy 
      to promote the album. Lyrically, Human explores themes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, life, and the interconnectedness between humanity and nature.
